    "This mini-lab targets some hands-on implementations and more practice on cuda in common real-world recurring tasks. Moreover, we aim to compare the outcomes of our low-level implementations with the built-in functions in popular frameworks as Pytorch. We'll revisit how you can fool cuda by passing a 2D array (for easier indexing)! Then we'll go straight to implement our Conv3D kernel function!"

    "### **Requirement**\n",
    "\n",
    "A) A cuda program is required to carry out a 3D convolution over RGB images and save the output ones, the program is given a path to a folder containing the input images and that of an output folder that should contain the outputs, respectively as command line arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   kernel1: basic implementation (no tiling)\n",
    "2.   kernel2: tiling where each block matches the input tile size.\n",
    "3.   kernel3: tiling where each block matches the output tile size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "*   Add necessary paddings so that the output image size is the same as that of the input one if stride = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The kernel should be able to handle a batch of images at a time, the batch size is passed as the 3rd argument.\n",
    "*   The mask is given in a .txt file, whose path is passed as the 4th argument. The first line contains its dimension n (one number only as it's a square mask) then the consecutive n lines contain the mask rows, each row in a separate line. Repeat the mask 3 times for the 3 channels of the image.\n",
    "* (BOUNS) handle different values of stride than 1\n",
    "\n",
    "  Ex: ./a.out input_folder_path output_folder_path 4 mask.txt stride\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Implement the same program in python, using the built-in convolution functions in Pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Profile each program carefully and do sufficient experiments to compare between them and collect insightful results. Organise your results in a tabular form and prepare a comprehensive report explaining all of your findings. Also mention the impact of declaring the mask as constant in terms of execution time and elaborate on this in your report."
